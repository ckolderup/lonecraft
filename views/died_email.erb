Oh no D:
Looks like you died in Lonecraft.

Unfortunately, your time in this world has come to an end. You can play again after the world resets... if you can get a token.

From here, though, you still have more to do! Please do the following as soon as possible:

1) Send a game token to someone else. You can get more information about that here:

http://<%= ENV['SITE_DOMAIN'] %>/pass

2) Write about your experience in this round here:

http://<%= ENV['SITE_DOMAIN'] %>/relate

Thanks for playing!
