Minebound is a web app that helps coordinate a special version of the Minecraft multiplayer server. Only one player is allowed in the game at a time, and the webapp portion communicates with the Minecraft server via Splash (http://www.github.com/ckolderup/Splash) and SSH to keep track of which Minecraft user is allowed in the server at any given time.

Minebound is a work in progress.

Things completed:
  - basic user account management
  - general site pages/navigation established

Things to do:
  - actual game logic (cashing in game tokens, communicating with the minecraft server)
  - secure auth
  - secure Splash communications (requires work on Splash as well)
  - "confirm" step on user account signup
  - admin control panel to manually kickstart games and manage the archive of past games for download
  - a lot of style work :)
