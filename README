Lonecraft is a web app that helps coordinate a special version of the Minecraft multiplayer server. Only one player is allowed in the game at a time, and the webapp portion communicates with the Minecraft server via Splash (http://www.github.com/ckolderup/Splash) and SSH to keep track of which Minecraft user is allowed in the server at any given time.

Lonecraft is a work in progress. Right now it's not secure and probably kind of broken. 

Things completed:
  - basic user account management
  - general site pages/navigation established
  - basic game logic (cashing in game tokens, communicating with the minecraft server)
  - nail down game logic through an entire cycle of play

Things to do:
  - blogging support so you can write about games you've played in and a cohesive story of past games can be viewed
  - admin control panel to manually kickstart games and manage the archive of past games for download
  - secure auth
  - secure Splash communications (requires work on Splash as well)
  - "confirm" step on user account signup
  - a lot of style work :)
